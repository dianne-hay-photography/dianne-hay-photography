		<p>We are very pleased that we chose Dianne Hay Photography to capture the precious memories of our wedding day.</p>
		<p>Dianne was on the go all the time...from the bride and bridesmaids early preparations for our morning wedding, to capturing the ceremony and all the guests, the wedding party shots on the grounds, and throughout the reception.</p>
		<p>Dianne was literally everywhere ... if she wasn't getting in on filming the kids entertainment and capturing their happy faces then she was busy picking up on special moments - capturing unique portrait shots of guests and everyone having fun, obliging with the inescapable group shots requested on demand from family and friends wanting a memento of their time together, and of course the more formal proceedings - nothing was too much trouble and we were impressed with her keen eye.</p>
		<p>Thank you so very much Dianne for all your seamless effort, attention to detail and of course the amazing results with our wedding photos.</p>
		<p>Thank you again for such a wonderful job you did for us!</p>
		<p>All the very best - and I wish you continued success in your business.</p>
		<p>Regards,</p>
		<p>Kim and Greg Worrall<br>Lidcombe NSW</p>

		<p>We choose Dianne Hay to photograph our wedding reception as after seeing some of her other work we decided that we really liked her style. And we were not disappointed - all our photos came out beautifully, right from the group photos, the photos of just the two of us, to the relaxed and spontaneous photos taken through out the night. Even despite the torrential rain on the day Dianne managed to get some spectacular shots, somehow making the rain work to her advantage.</p>
		<p>Dianne herself was a pleasure to work with, she was very professional, managed to put everyone at ease and perhaps most importantly showed extreme patience when trying to organise everyone into group photos. She also thought of many photos that we had not even considered that have ended up being a brilliant addition to the album. Her style is able to encompass many styles of photography, and in fact some of our favourites are the unplanned shots taken on the dance floor as well as the beautiful and intimate photos of my husband and I that we will treasure for the rest of our lives.</p>
		<p>Ultimately we were very happy with our decision to use Dianne Hay Photography, I have got the wedding album I had always pictured and it was a joy to have Dianne with us on the day, I very much doubt that without her professional yet friendly manner we would have managed to get half of the beautiful photos we now have.</p>
		<p>So thank you so much Dianne for giving us the perfect photos for a perfect day.</p>

		<p>I have personally recommended Dianne Hay, Principle of Dianne Hay Photography to friends, colleagues and businesses partners.</p>
		<p>I have found Dianne to be consistently professional and her work of continual high standard. Her photographs are always complete by deadline, are highly cost effective and fabulous quality! You will get the best of Dianne's experience with every assignment she undertakes - she really understands personal customer service and her work is quite 'breathtaking' [she is degree qualified not just an enthusiast].</p>
		<p>Dianne has exhibited her photography at several art shows and is completely comfortable taking pictures in an assortment of environments namely:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Weddings</li>
			<li>Portraiture (family, children, pets)</li>
			<li>Parties &amp; Engagements</li>
			<li>Real Estate</li>
			<li>Commercial Portraiture</li>
			<li>Live Entertainment</li>
			<li>Commercial (web sites)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Dianne will also produce the most magnificent <i>Wedding Albums</i> or <i>Coffee Table Picky Books</i>. I know because I have my own Coffee Table Picky Book from my 50th Birthday. Now all my friends want one either for themselves or for a family gift.</p>
		<p>To stand in front of Dianne's lens is not intimidating at all - she is so relaxed she puts her subjects at ease! I know she will happily go out on location or she has a fully equipped studio in her home.</p>
		<p>As you can see I think Dianne Hay is a pretty good photographer!</p>
